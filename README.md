This is the README for Daniel Thompson's front-end coding project. For this excercise I decided to make a digital resume for myself, speaking on my work experience and education - while also displaying my coding abilities.
Used multiple custom classes in HTML for CSS customization. 
*The ".top-content" class targets the Title and Subtitle to stick to the top and styled in flexbox to sit on the right side.
*The ".total" class targets the Main content and Secondary content, styling with flexbox to create responsiveness.
*The ".links" class targets the icons at the bottom of the page, organizing and placing them with flexbox.
Using basic JavaScript, drafted a popup function on the click of the submit button at the bottom of the form.
Through media queries, responsiveness was attained by manipulating the ".total" class and using the Flex Flow rule on smaller screens.
